        Denouncing Lithuania's False Democracy

        <h1>The Illusion of Democracy in Lithuania</h1>
        <p>For almost a century, Lithuania has lived under the lie of a so-called democracy. Ever since 
        Smetona’s 1926 coup, what we've had is nothing more than a rigged system designed to uphold 
        the interests of the elite. <strong>Smetona’s authoritarian legacy still runs through our veins 
        today</strong>, even though politicians hide behind elections and call it democracy. It’s a 
        <strong>false democracy</strong>, where the real power stays with those who control the wealth 
        and resources of the country.</p>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Smetona_in_Lithuania.jpg/800px-Smetona_in_Lithuania.jpg" alt="Antanas Smetona">

        <h2>The Continued Impact of Smetonian Politics</h2>
        <p>Since independence, Lithuania has fallen deeper into <strong>neoliberal capitalism</strong>, 
        and every political party that’s come along has only been a slightly different version of the 
        same pro-capitalist machine. The <strong>bourgeoisie controls the show</strong>, and politicians—from the conservatives 
        to the so-called centrists—have no solutions for the people. Instead, they keep shoving capitalist 
        policies down our throats, leaving us with <strong>wage stagnation</strong>, a growing wealth gap, and a workforce 
        forced to emigrate to survive. They’ve perfected the art of <strong>distracting us with nationalism and anti-leftist 
        propaganda</strong> while ignoring the real problems we face.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
            "True democracy is not just about elections; it’s about the people having real power." 
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Mirage of Choice</h3>
        <p><strong>Smetonian democracy is still alive</strong>, not because of tradition, but because it serves 
        the elite class perfectly. It creates the illusion that we have a choice while keeping us locked 
        in the <strong>chains of capitalism</strong>. What we’re calling democracy is a scam. The <strong>
        ruling class gets richer</strong>, while we—the workers, students, and marginalized—get nothing but 
        more struggle. The system is designed to protect the <strong>bourgeoisie</strong>, and as long as 
        we stay within its framework, we’ll never see real change.</p>

        <h2>The Role of the Revolutionary Communist International</h2>
        <p>This is where the <strong>Revolutionary Communist International (RCi)</strong> comes in. Unlike the 
        politicians who have sold out to capitalist interests, we’re here to offer the <strong>real alternative</strong>. 
        The RCi is about <strong>restoring true democracy</strong>—a democracy where the working class takes control 
        of the economy, the state, and its future. We’re done playing by the rules of the bourgeoisie. It’s time 
        to <strong>overthrow this system</strong> and establish <strong>workers' power</strong>.</p>

        <button onclick="showAlert()">Join the Revolution</button>

        <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
        <p>We don’t need more parties feeding us the same tired capitalist rhetoric. We need a <strong>revolution</strong> 
        that destroys the capitalist state and builds a new one in its place—run by and for the people. The 
        current system won’t change unless we make it change. The time for <strong>revolutionary action is now</strong>. 
        If you’re tired of this broken democracy and fed up with politicians who refuse to challenge the elite, 
        then join us. <strong>Join the RCi</strong> and be part of the movement that will finally put power where 
        it belongs—in the hands of the people.</p>
